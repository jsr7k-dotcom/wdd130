        <p>The Aqueduct of Quer√©taro, a masterpiece of hydraulic engineering built between 1726 and 1738, consists of 74
            majestic
            arches that reach an average height of 28.5 meters over a span of 1,298 meters. Its original purpose was to
            supply water
            to the city.

            Constructed from pink quarry stone, this monument has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since
            1996,
            highlighting its historical and architectural significance. Today, the Aqueduct of Quer√©taro stands as an
            iconic symbol
            not only of the city but of the entire state of Quer√©taro.</p>
