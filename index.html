            <p>My name is Roberto Hernandez. I'm originally from Mexico City but am currently living here in Querétaro.

                By profession, I am a Data Analyst for a global nutrition company, where I enjoy diving into complex
                datasets to uncover
                business insights. A good example of my work is a recent project where I developed a call volume
                forecast for a large
                call centre. This involved analysing a detailed, three-year dataset—broken down into 30-minute intervals
                across multiple
                languages and agent skills—to accurately predict future trends. I primarily work within the Microsoft
                ecosystem to build
                practical, enterprise-level solutions.

                Outside of my professional life, I like to maintain a healthy balance. I'm an avid runner, I enjoy
                exploring my creative
                side through cooking, and I always have some music on in the background. </p>

            <h2>Querétaro, México</h2>
            <img src="/images/my-city.jpg" alt="The aqueduct of Querétaro City." width="200">
            <p>The Aqueduct of Querétaro, a masterpiece of hydraulic engineering built between 1726 and 1738, consists
                of 74
                majestic
                arches that reach an average height of 28.5 meters over a span of 1,298 meters. Its original purpose was
                to
                supply water
                to the city.

                Constructed from pink quarry stone, this monument has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                since
                1996,
                highlighting its historical and architectural significance. Today, the Aqueduct of Querétaro stands as
                an
                iconic symbol
                not only of the city but of the entire state of Querétaro.</p>
